This article talks about the difference between Software Architecture and Design, and why it is important for a
software developer to know a bit about architecture, but a lot about design. Software architecture deals with
integrating “flexibility, reusability, and security” into a structured solution that is feasible both technically
and on the business front. Software Architecture Patterns involve Serverless Architecture, Event-Driven
Architecture, and Microservices Architecture. These patters help developer save time while debugging, establish
a connect with the consumer, and specialized way of solving tasks attributing to unique solutions. 

Software Design, on the other hand, is important for what each module is going, the classes scope and the function
purpose. It incorporates the factory pattern and the adapter pattern that help developers execute the SOLID
principle. Thus, being through with design makes collaboration and internal communication with the team easier. 

I found the article particularly interesting because I always thought software architecture may be more important 
that Software Design as in a live product it may be more necessary to establish a connect with the consumer,
develop unique solutions for solving tasks. However, in the long term focusing on a good design automatically
yields a good architecture. While building the product, as developers, we will be taking into consideration the
factory pattern which saves time in the future, and the design pattern, which can handle easy adjustment of new few
changes and ensure forward compatibility. Building one’s product based on these patterns, “flexibility,
reusability, and security” naturally falls into place.
